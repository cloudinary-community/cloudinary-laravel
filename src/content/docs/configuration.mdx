This SDK implements the [File Storage](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/filesystem#main-content) Driver interface allowing you to use it as just another storage destination like s3, azure or local disk.

Add a new `cloudinary` key to your `config/filesystems.php` disk key like so:

<CodeBlock alwaysExpanded>
```php
  ...,
  'cloudinary' => [
      'driver' => 'cloudinary',
      'key' => env('CLOUDINARY_KEY'),
      'secret' => env('CLOUDINARY_SECRET'),
      'cloud' => env('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME'),
      'url' => env('CLOUDINARY_URL'),
      'secure' => (bool) env('CLOUDINARY_SECURE', true),
      'prefix' => env('CLOUDINARY_PREFIX'),
  ],
...,
```
</CodeBlock>
