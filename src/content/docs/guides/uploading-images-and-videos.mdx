Laravel Cloudinary provides a seamless way to integrate Cloudinary's powerful upload capabilities into your Laravel project. This guide will show you how to use the `<x-cloudinary::widget>` component to add upload functionality to your application.

# `<x-cloudinary::widget>` Component

The `<x-cloudinary::widget>` component is a wrapper around Cloudinary's Upload Widget, specifically optimized for Laravel projects. It allows you to easily add upload functionality with minimal configuration.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the widget in your Blade templates:

```blade
<x-cloudinary::widget>Upload to Cloudinary</x-cloudinary::widget>
```

## Configuration Options
Todo

## Best Practices and Tips
1. Always use upload presets to control what can be uploaded to your Cloudinary account.
2. Implement signed uploads for enhanced security, especially in production environments.
3. Customize the upload widget to match your application's design and user experience.
4. Consider implementing upload restrictions (file types, sizes) using Cloudinarys upload presets.
