## Usage

## **Upload, Retrieval & Transformation Media Method Calls**:

**Upload** a file (_Image_, _Video_ or any type of _File_) to **Cloudinary**, **retrieve** and **transform** via any of the following ways:

```php

/**
*  Using the Cloudinary Facade
*/

// access the admin api
(https://cloudinary.com/documentation/admin_api)
Cloudinary::admin();

// access the search api
(https://cloudinary.com/documentation/search_api)
Cloudinary::search();

// access the upload api
(https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference)
Cloudinary::uploadApi();

// Upload an Image File to Cloudinary with One line of Code
$uploadedFileUrl = Cloudinary::upload($request->file('file')->getRealPath())->getSecurePath();

// Upload a Video File to Cloudinary with One line of Code
$uploadedFileUrl = Cloudinary::uploadVideo($request->file('file')->getRealPath())->getSecurePath();

// Upload any File to Cloudinary with One line of Code
$uploadedFileUrl = Cloudinary::uploadFile($request->file('file')->getRealPath())->getSecurePath();

// get url from a file
$url = Cloudinary::getUrl($publicId);


/**
 *  This package also exposes a helper function you can use if you are not a fan of Facades
 *  Shorter, expressive, fluent using the
 *  cloudinary() function
 */

// access the admin api
(https://cloudinary.com/documentation/admin_api)
cloudinary()->admin();

// access the search api
(https://cloudinary.com/documentation/search_api)
cloudinary()->search();

// access the upload api
(https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference)
cloudinary()->uploadApi();

// Upload an image file to cloudinary with one line of code
$uploadedFileUrl = cloudinary()->upload($request->file('file')->getRealPath())->getSecurePath();

// Upload a video file to cloudinary with one line of code
$uploadedFileUrl = cloudinary()->uploadVideo($request->file('file')->getRealPath())->getSecurePath();

// Upload any file  to cloudinary with one line of code
$uploadedFileUrl = cloudinary()->uploadFile($request->file('file')->getRealPath())->getSecurePath();

// Upload an existing remote file to Cloudinary with one line of code
$uploadedFileUrl = cloudinary()->uploadFile($remoteFileUrl)->getSecurePath();

// get url from a file
$url = cloudinary()->getUrl($publicId);

/**
 *  You can also skip the Cloudinary Facade or helper method and laravel-ize your uploads by simply calling the
 *  storeOnCloudinary() method on the file itself
 */

// Store the uploaded file on Cloudinary
$result = $request->file('file')->storeOnCloudinary();

// Store the uploaded file on Cloudinary
$result = $request->file->storeOnCloudinary();

// Store the uploaded file in the "lambogini" directory on Cloudinary
$result = $request->file->storeOnCloudinary('lambogini');

// Store the uploaded file in the "lambogini" directory on Cloudinary with the filename "prosper"
$result = $request->file->storeOnCloudinaryAs('lambogini', 'prosper');

$result->getPath(); // Get the url of the uploaded file; http
$result->getSecurePath(); // Get the url of the uploaded file; https
$result->getSize(); // Get the size of the uploaded file in bytes
$result->getReadableSize(); // Get the size of the uploaded file in bytes, megabytes, gigabytes or terabytes. E.g 1.8 MB
$result->getFileType(); // Get the type of the uploaded file
$result->getFileName(); // Get the file name of the uploaded file
$result->getOriginalFileName(); // Get the file name of the file before it was uploaded to Cloudinary
$result->getPublicId(); // Get the public_id of the uploaded file
$result->getExtension(); // Get the extension of the uploaded file
$result->getWidth(); // Get the width of the uploaded file
$result->getHeight(); // Get the height of the uploaded file
$result->getTimeUploaded(); // Get the time the file was uploaded

/**
 * You can also check if a file exists
 */

$url = Storage::disk('cloudinary')->fileExists($publicId);
```

## **Attach Files** to Laravel **Eloquent Models**:

First, import the `CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\MediaAlly` trait into your Model like so:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\MediaAlly;

class Page extends Model
{
    use MediaAlly;

    ...
}
```

Next, publish the package's migration file using this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\CloudinaryServiceProvider" --tag="cloudinary-laravel-migration"
```

**Note:** Once this has been published, run `php artisan migrate` to create the required table in your Database.

You can now attach media assets to your model like so:

```php
/**
 *  How to attach a file to a Model by model creation
 */
$page = Page::create($this->request->input());
$page->attachMedia($file);   // Example of $file is $request->file('file');

/**
 *  How to attach a file to a Model by retrieving model records
 */
$page = Page::find(2);
$page->attachMedia($file);  // Example of $file is $request->file('file');

/**
 *  How to retrieve files that were attached to a Model
 */
$filesBelongingToSecondPage = Page::find(2)->fetchAllMedia();

/**
 *  How to retrieve the first file that was attached to a Model
 */
$fileBelongingToSecondPage = Page::find(2)->fetchFirstMedia();

/**
 *  How to retrieve the last file that was attached to a Model
 */
$fileBelongingToSecondPage = Page::find(2)->fetchLastMedia();

/**
 *  How to replace/update files attached to a Model
 */
$page = Page::find(2);
$page->updateMedia($file);  // Example of $file is $request->file('file');

/**
*  How to detach a file from a Model
*/
$page = Page::find(2);
$page->detachMedia($file)  // Example of $file is $request->file('file');
```

## **Upload Files Via An Upload Widget**:

Use the `x-cld-upload-button` Blade upload button component that ships with this Package like so:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        ...
        @cloudinaryJS
    </head>
    <body>
        <x-cld-upload-button>
            Upload Files
        </x-cld-upload-button>
    </body>
</html>
````

Other Blade components you can use are:

```php
<x-cld-image public-id="prosper" width="300" height="300"></x-cld-image> // Blade Image Component for displaying images

<x-cld-video public-id="awesome"></x-cld-video> // Blade Video Component for displaying videos
```

## **Media Management via The Command Line**:

```bash
/**
*  Back-up Files on Cloudinary
*/
php artisan cloudinary:backup

/**
 *  Delete a File on Cloudinary
 */
php artisan cloudinary:delete

/**
 * Fetch a File from Cloudinary
 */
php artisan cloudinary:fetch

/**
 * Rename a File from Cloudinary
 */
php artisan cloudinary:rename

/**
 * Upload a File to Cloudinary
 */
php artisan cloudinary:upload
```


## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 7.2+, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

To get the latest version of Laravel Cloudinary, simply require it:

```bash
composer require cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel
```

Or add the following line to the require block of your `composer.json` file.

### Apps Using Laravel 9

```
"cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel": "2.0.0"
```

### Apps Using Laravel 8 and below

```
"cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel": "1.0.4"
```

You'll then need to run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.


Once Laravel Cloudinary is installed, you need to register the service provider. Open up `config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\CloudinaryServiceProvider::class,
    ...
]
```

> Note: If you use **Laravel >= 5.5** , you can skip this step (adding the code above to the providers key) and go to [**`configuration`**](https://github.com/cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel#configuration)

Also, register the Cloudinary Facade like so:

```php
'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Cloudinary' => CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\Facades\Cloudinary::class,
    ...
]
```

> Note: If you use **Laravel >= 9.0** , you can skip the step (adding the code above for registering the facade) and can just import it in whatever class you need it like so:

```php
  ...
  use CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\Facades\Cloudinary;
  ...
```


## Configuration

You can publish the configuration file using this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="CloudinaryLabs\CloudinaryLaravel\CloudinaryServiceProvider" --tag="cloudinary-laravel-config"
```

A configuration file named `cloudinary.php` with some sensible defaults will be placed in your `config` directory:

```php
<?php
return [
     /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Cloudinary Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to notify your application (a webhook) when the process of uploads, deletes, and any API
    | that accepts notification_url has completed.
    |
    |
    */
    'notification_url' => env('CLOUDINARY_NOTIFICATION_URL'),


    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Cloudinary Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here you may configure your Cloudinary settings. Cloudinary is a cloud hosted
    | media management service for all file uploads, storage, delivery and transformation needs.
    |
    |
    */
    'cloud_url' => env('CLOUDINARY_URL'),

    /**
    * Upload Preset From Cloudinary Dashboard
    *
    */
    'upload_preset' => env('CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET')
];
```

### API Keys
Open your `.env` file and add your API Environment variable, upload_preset (this is optional, until you need to use the widget) like so:

```php
CLOUDINARY_URL=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLOUDINARY_NOTIFICATION_URL=
```

***Note:** You need to get these credentials from your [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console)*

*If you are using a hosting service like heroku, forge, digital ocean, etc, please ensure to add the above details to your configuration variables.*

### Cloudinary JS

Cloudinary relies on its own JavaScript library to initiate the Cloudinary Upload Widget. You can load the JavaScript library by placing the @cloudinaryJS directive right before your application layout's closing </head> tag:

```html
<head>
    ...

    @cloudinaryJS
</head>
```

***Note:** ONLY LOAD THIS IF YOU HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE UPLOAD WIDGET. IF YOU ARE USING THIS PACKAGE FOR A LARAVEL API BACKEND, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS!*
