Optimization plays a critical role in making your website load as fast as possible.

With the [Image](/components/image) component, your images will be automatically optimized with automatic compression and by delivering the most efficient format based on your browser or device (WebP, AVIF, etc).

:::tip
You can further optimize delivery with responsive sizing by using the `sizes` prop.

# Example

```blade
<x-cloudinary::image 
  public-id="example" 
  width="960" 
  height="600" 
  sizes="100vw" 
  alt="My example"
/>
```
